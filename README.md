# Continuous integration 

This project is an example of Continuous Integration. 
It is [Jenkins CI](http://jenkins-ci.org/) running [Mocha](http://mochajs.org/) tests with cross-browser [SauceLabs](saucelabs.com) integrations on [Selenium RC](http://www.seleniumhq.org/projects/remote-control/) via [Webdriver.io](http://webdriver.io/) javascript bindings and [WebdriverCSS](https://github.com/webdriverio/webdrivercss) visual regression tests via [Applitools](applitools.com).

# Workflow Overview

1. Developer pushes changed code base to `production` branch
2. Git commit triggers `jenkins` build script
3. When build script is successfully executed, `jenkins` runs Mocha tests.  
4. When all tests pass, than `jenkins` triggers production deployment.

# Project configuration

Project configuration consists of setting up Jenkins remote server, install dependencies it will need for re-creating production server environment and mocha-webdriverio-webdrivercss tests, setup ssh keys for remote accessing and git hooks for triggering Jenkins.  

* Setup ssh keys 
* Install `oh-my-zsh`
* Install `git` and `z` plugins for zsh
* Install `git`
* Install Node.js
* Install npm 
* Install SeleniumRC
* Install Webdriver.io
* Install WebdriverCSS
* Install dependencies for WebdriverCSS
* Install Jenkins
* Install plugins for Jenkins
* Configure Jenkins
* Setup git hooks

# Glossary 

* [Selenium RC(Remote Control)](http://www.seleniumhq.org/projects/remote-control/) - is an API accessible from multiple languages. Rather than recording tests, you write programs that call into the API to control the browser
* [WebdriverIO](http://webdriver.io/) - Selenium 2.0 bindings for NodeJS
* [WebdriverCSS](https://github.com/webdriverio/webdrivercss) - is a plugin for an automatic visual regression for WebdriverIO. After initialization it enhances a WebdriverIO instance with an additional command called webdrivercss and enables the possibility to save screenshots of specific parts of your application
* [SauceLabs Integration](https://github.com/webdriverio/webdriverio/blob/master/examples/webdriverio.browserstack.js) - Automated Cross-Browser testing with wide collection of plattforms, devices and browser combinations.
* [Applitools Eyes](https://applitools.com/) - is a comprehensive automated UI validation solution with really smart image matching algorithms that are unique in this area. As a cloud service it makes your regression tests available everywhere and accessible to everyone in your team, and its automated maintenance features simplify baseline maintenance.
* [Jenkins CI](jenkins-ci.org) - is an open source continuous integration tool written in Java. It provides continuous integration services for software development. It is a server-based system running in a servlet container.
* [Mocha](http://mochajs.org/) - Mocha is a feature-rich JavaScript test framework running on node.js and the browser, making asynchronous testing simple and fun
